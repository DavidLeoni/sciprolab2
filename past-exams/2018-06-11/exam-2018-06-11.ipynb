    "\n",
    "Our `Supermarket` should maximize the number of served clients (we assume each clients is served in an equal amount of time). To do so, the whole supermarket itself can be seen as a particular kind of queue, which allows the `enqueue` and `dequeue` operations described as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "* by calling `supermarket.enqueue(client)` a client gets enqueued in the shortest `CashQueue`.\n",
    "\n",
    "* by calling `supermarket.dequeue()`, all clients which are at the heads of non-empty `CashQueue`s are dequeued all at once, and their list is returned (this simulates parallelism).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Implementation \n",
    "\n",
    "Now start editing `exerciseB2.py` implementing methods in the following points."
