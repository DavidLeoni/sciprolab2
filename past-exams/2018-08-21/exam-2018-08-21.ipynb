A possible way to compute the `N50` is to sort all the contig sizes decreasingly and compute the cumulative sum of the sizes starting from the biggest contig. The size that makes the cumulative sum go above the $50\\%$ of the total sum is the `N50` value. Similarly, the size that makes the cumulative sum go above the $20\\%$, $30\\%$, $X\\%$ of the total sum is the `N20`, `N30`, `NX` value. In the example below, the `N50` is 60.  \n",
